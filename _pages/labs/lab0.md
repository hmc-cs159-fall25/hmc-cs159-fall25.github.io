title: "Lab 0: Regex in-class activity"
---

This lab is not graded; you will get full credit as long as you submit _something_ on Gradescope. That said, you should treat this as a chance to practice your journaling skills, and we will give you feedback on your submitted journals so that you're more likely to get full credit on the "real" labs!

In addition to letting you practice your journaling, this activity is meant as a way to get everyone caught up with regular expressions (aka regex). Regex is not one of the main topics of CS 159 (and will not be on the exam), but it _is_ an extremely useful tool when working with text data! The problem is, different people in this class may have different levels of prior exposure to regex (maybe for some of you, this week's reading is the first you've heard of it). So this is meant as a chance for you to help each other out! Get up, walk around the room, and ask each other for help; regex syntax is so nuanced that there's a good chance one of your peers knows something you don't. And remember, in your journal, be sure to cite anybody you got help from!

## Task: RegEx Practice

Practice regular expressions by playing [RegEx Golf](https://alf.nu/RegexGolf).

Challenge yourself to at least get through the following exercises: Warmup, Anchors, It never ends, Ranges, and Backrefs. And if you get through all of them, just keep going until you either run out or reach the end of the class session :) Because this lab is graded on completion only, you can feel free to just submit whatever you have at the end of class.

### Analysis Question #1

Which exercises did you end up finishing? Give us the regex you designed for each one.

### Analysis Question #2

Describe how this activity went for you. Were any puzzles particularly challenging, and what made them challenging? Alternately, is there any regex you're particularly proud of devising, and if so, why?
